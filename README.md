## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

All the necessary libraries to run the code were already available in the Anaconda distribution of Python, except:
1. scikit-optimize, which can be installed through `!pip install scikit-optimize`;
2. lightgbm, which can be installed through `!pip install lightgbm`.

This script was written using Python version 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This was the chosen project to be developed as the Capstone Project for the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree. I am passionate about data, and especially data related to people somehow.

Customer Segmentation is all about understanding people, how they behave, what they like, how they think, and so on. I really enjoy putting together the pieces of this puzzle.

Besides that, I felt like it would be a great challenge to work on real data, giving me the chance to overcome the problems that come up in the daily life of any data scientist.  

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

1. Notebook - Jupyter Notebook with the script containing the whole solution of the project.
2. joblib files (`azdias`, `customers`, `train`, and `test`) - compacted versions of the datasets used in this project.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

All the process as well as the results and findings were documented in this Medium [post](https://evertonbin.medium.com/customer-segmentation-arvato-bertelsmann-project-44e73210a1b7).
